  bio: I am a passionate QA Engineer, have experience in testing Web Applications manually and using automation scripts, as well as API Testing (Postman, SOAP UI). I can support my mentees by sharing knowledge and helpful resources. I believe that testing is way more than just finding bugs and flaws, but looking at process and product from the user perspective. Since I am a big fan of exploratory testing, we can also test together during our mentorship sessions! Apart from the technical part I am interested in exploring different aspects in team communication, cross cultural collaboration and volunteering in professional communities!

    Irina is a Director of Women Who Code London and a Senior Backend Software Engineer at Revolut. Her experience as a Software Engineer included working with large projects, search engines, distributed systems, performance issues, and huge data storage. Apart from being a strong developer and a good team player, in the last 3-years, she volunteered for CodeFirst: Girls and Women Who Code London and grew up from volunteer to lead and, in the end, to a Senior Director role within the community. She organised a team to deliver outstanding projects and show impressive results. She built a guild of volunteers to deliver a Mentorship Programme, technical tracks, help with resumes, mock interviews and overall grown community more than triple. As the next step, she will help other networks by holding the position of Senior Director in WWCode. Currently, she works at Revolut and building a platform for retail products. That includes support services to handle our 30 million clients, handle huge throughput and provide law latency for data flow. Irina constantly helps her team to tackle the extra mile and help the company to improve an intervening process, onboarding new hires, navigating interns and running knowledge-sharing activities. As a cherry on top, she helped to launch the inner Revolut Women Guild ‚ÄúRevWomen‚Äù. Recently I contributed to my University as a lecturer and designed materials for a course of Software Architecture. This year, I'm connecting different Universities in England with WWCode London to bring more diversity in tech from inspiring the young generation."

  bio: |
    I'm a senior iOS developer with ten years of business experience and over 25 years in software development. I spent the first 15 years working as a back-end developer in .NET and Java, but I fell in love when I discovered Mobile development. I am passionate about the quality and maintainability of the application's code and architecture.
    <br>I have already lived in some European cities, such as Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona and London. This allowed me to work in different cultures and dynamics, further increasing my ability to connect, communicate and grow. I love giving back to the community, so I started collaborating with DevPass, helping guide newcomers. I'm also a mentor at MentoCruise, for those who want a more professional follow-up.

  bio: Hi! My name is Min, I‚Äôm a kiwi, and I am a senior Machine Learning / Full-stack Software Engineer of 7 years experience who has worked in a wide range of work environments including a FAANG, a Unicorn, a small startup, and most recently my own startup. From my experience, I‚Äôve seen time and time again how the skewed gender ratio in tech negatively impacts everything we do in tech, and what we build. To combat this, I have mentored with WomenWhoCode before, and I have taught a few courses with CodeFirstGirls before. I would like to continue supporting more women to get into tech industry and moreover succeed in the industry until we have truly achieved gender equality and equity in the tech industry.

I'm currently working in green tech for a non-profit organization focused on ocean conservation and I am passionate about technology for good. In my current role we track ship movements and use AI to detect vessel behaviour.

I have previously spent 8 years working within the aviation sector developing web and mobile applications using mainly JavaScript.

  bio: |
    I've been a software engineer for the past 3 years, always close to core financial technologies: building API designer platform for mainframe customers at IBM and core banking platform at Starling Bank. Coming from an unconventional background in materials science, I learned coding pretty much autodidact, and have the scar tissue that is my graveyard of projects on GitHub. Plenty of people have helped me along the way, and here I am paying it forward by mentoring at Women who Code!
